# Oracle Context Compression Prompt

The conversation has reached {{ tokens_used }} tokens out of a {{ token_budget }} token budget ({{ usage_percent }}%). You need to compress older exchanges while preserving essential context for continuity.

## Compression Principles

### What to Preserve (High Priority)

1. **Key Decisions**
   - Architectural choices made during the conversation
   - User preferences or constraints expressed
   - Conclusions reached after analysis

2. **Important Discoveries**
   - Critical code paths identified
   - Bugs or issues found
   - Relationships between components

3. **Recent Exchanges** (last 3-5 turns)
   - Keep verbatim for immediate context
   - Preserve exact citations and code snippets

4. **Active References**
   - Files currently being discussed
   - Symbols the user has asked about
   - Threads that have been read or written to

### What to Summarize (Medium Priority)

1. **Tool Call Results**
   - Replace raw results with key findings
   - Keep citations, remove verbose output

2. **Exploratory Searches**
   - Note what was searched and what was found
   - Remove detailed listings if not directly relevant

3. **Background Context**
   - Summarize earlier explanations
   - Preserve the gist, not the details

### What to Remove (Low Priority)

1. **Redundant Information**
   - Repeated explanations
   - Superseded findings (if corrected later)

2. **Failed Searches**
   - Unless the failure itself is informative

3. **Verbose Tool Output**
   - Full file contents if only a section was relevant
   - Long code listings if already explained

## Compression Format

Generate a compressed summary in this structure:

```markdown
## Session Summary

**Started**: {{ session_start }}
**Turns compressed**: {{ turns_compressed }}

### Key Decisions
- [List each decision with brief rationale]

### Discoveries
- [List significant findings with citations]

### Current Focus
- [What the user is currently working on]
- [Active files/symbols being discussed]

### Context for Continuation
- [Any information needed to answer follow-up questions]
```

## Current Conversation State

**Recent exchanges to preserve verbatim**:
{{ recent_exchanges_json }}

**Key decisions recorded**:
{{ key_decisions_json }}

**Files mentioned**: {{ mentioned_files }}
**Symbols mentioned**: {{ mentioned_symbols }}

## Compression Task

Compress the older portions of this conversation while:

1. Keeping the last {{ preserve_recent }} exchanges intact
2. Preserving all key decisions listed above
3. Maintaining enough context for coherent continuation
4. Reducing total token count by at least {{ reduction_target }}%

Output the compressed summary that will replace older exchanges. The summary should be self-contained - someone reading only the summary and recent exchanges should understand the conversation's context.

## Important Notes

- **Never lose decisions**: If a decision was made, it must appear in the summary
- **Preserve citations**: Even in summary form, keep source references
- **Note what was removed**: If significant context is being compressed, briefly note what topics were covered
- **Err on the side of keeping**: When uncertain, preserve rather than discard
