We've built a custom integration that allows ChatGPT to natively interact with this documentation vault.

## Features

- **Search Widget**: Ask ChatGPT "Search for API docs" and get a clean list of results.
- **Note Viewer**: Ask "Show me the Getting Started note" and see the full markdown rendered in an interactive widget.
- **In-Context Editing**: Ask ChatGPT to edit a note, and see the changes reflected immediately.

## How to Connect

1. Go to **ChatGPT** -> **Explore GPTs** -> **Create**.
2. Click **Configure** -> **Create new action**.
3. Select **Authentication**: `None` (for this Demo instance).
4. Enter the **Schema**: Import from URL `https://[your-space-url].hf.space/openapi.json`.
5. Save and test!

## Using the App

Try these prompts:

- "What notes do I have about architecture?"
- "Read the [[Architecture Overview]] note."
- "Create a new note called 'Meeting Notes' with a summary of our chat."

## Technical Details

This integration uses the **OpenAI Apps SDK** and our **FastMCP** backend.
The backend injects special metadata (`_meta.openai.outputTemplate`) into MCP tool responses, telling ChatGPT to render our custom **Widget** (`widget.html`) instead of plain text.

See [[Architecture Overview]] for more."""

Wikilinks are a powerful way to connect notes using simple `[[bracket]]` syntax.

## Basic Wikilinks

Link to other notes by title:

- [[Getting Started]]
- [[API Documentation]]
- [[MCP Integration]]

## How It Works

Wikilinks are resolved using **normalized slug matching**:

1. The link text is normalized (lowercase, spaces to dashes)
2. The system checks note titles and filenames
3. Same-folder matches are preferred
4. Broken links are styled differently

## Broken Links

If you create a link to a note that doesn't exist, like [[Nonexistent Note]], it will be styled as a broken link.

## Backlinks

When you link to a note, it automatically appears in that note's backlinks section. Try viewing [[Getting Started]] to see this note in its backlinks!

## Advanced Features

- Links are indexed for fast resolution
- The [[Search Features]] include wikilink graph analysis
- See [[Architecture Overview]] for implementation details"""

The Document Viewer is built with a modern tech stack optimized for AI-human collaboration.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **FastAPI** - HTTP API server
- **FastMCP** - MCP server for AI agents (supports StdIO and SSE/HTTP)
- **SQLite FTS5** - Full-text search engine
- **python-frontmatter** - YAML metadata parsing

### Frontend

- **React + Vite** - Modern web framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **react-force-graph** - Interactive graph visualization

## ChatGPT Integration

We use a hybrid approach for the [[ChatGPT App Integration]]:

1. **FastMCP** exposes tools (`read_note`) via HTTP.
2. Tools return `CallToolResult` with `_meta.openai.outputTemplate`.
3. ChatGPT renders our **Widget** (`widget.html`) in an iframe.
4. The Widget reuses React components from the main app (`NoteViewer`) for a consistent look.

## Multi-Tenancy

Each user gets an isolated vault at `data/vaults/{user_id}/`. See [[API Documentation]] for authentication."""

The Document Viewer includes powerful full-text search with intelligent ranking.

## BM25 Ranking

Search uses the BM25 algorithm with custom weights:

- **Title matches**: 3x weight
- **Body matches**: 1x weight
- **Recency bonus**: +1.0 for notes updated in last 7 days, +0.5 for last 30 days

## Search Syntax

Just type natural language queries:

- `authentication` - Find all notes mentioning authentication
- `api design` - Multiple terms are combined
- Searches are tokenized and case-insensitive

## Index Health

Check the footer of the main app to see:

- Total note count
- Last index update timestamp

Rebuild the index from [[Settings]] if needed.

Common issues and solutions.

## Search Not Finding Notes

**Problem**: Search returns no results or outdated results.

**Solution**: Go to [[Settings]] and click "Rebuild Index". This re-scans all notes and updates the search index.

## Wikilink Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking a wikilink doesn't navigate, or shows as broken.

**Solution**: 
- Check the target note exists
- Wikilinks match on normalized slugs (case-insensitive, spaces→dashes)
- See [[Wikilink Examples]] for how resolution works

## ChatGPT Widget Empty

**Problem**: The ChatGPT widget loads but shows a blank screen or error.

**Solution**:
- Check that `ENABLE_NOAUTH_MCP` is set to `true` (if using the demo instance).
- Ensure the backend URL is reachable from ChatGPT.
- Check if the note actually exists in the `demo-user` vault.

## Version Conflict on Save

**Problem**: "This note changed since you opened it" error when saving.

**Solution**: 
- Someone else (or an AI agent) edited the note while you were editing
- Reload the page to get the latest version
- Copy your changes and re-apply them
- This prevents data loss from concurrent edits

## Data Disappeared

**Problem**: Notes or changes are missing after page reload.

**Solution**:
- This is a **DEMO instance** with ephemeral storage
- Data resets when the server restarts
- For permanent storage, deploy your own instance (See [[Self Hosting]])"""

Frequently asked questions about the Document Viewer.

## General

**Q: What is this?**

A: An AI-powered documentation system where AI agents (via [[MCP Integration]]) can write and update docs, and humans can read and refine them in a beautiful UI.

**Q: Is my data persistent?**

A: **No, this is a demo instance.** All data is ephemeral and resets on server restart. For permanent storage, deploy your own instance (see [[Self Hosting]]).

**Q: How do I sign in?**

A: Click "Sign in with Hugging Face" on the login page. You'll authenticate via HF OAuth and get isolated vault access.

## ChatGPT Integration

**Q: How does the ChatGPT widget work?**

A: Our MCP server returns special metadata that tells ChatGPT to load an iframe with our custom `widget.html`. This reuses our React frontend code to render notes beautifully inside the chat. See [[ChatGPT App Integration]].

**Q: Can ChatGPT create notes?**

A: Yes! Ask it to "Create a note about X" and it will use the `write_note` tool.

## Technical

**Q: What tech stack?**

A: FastAPI + SQLite FTS5 backend, React + shadcn/ui frontend. See [[Architecture Overview]].

**Q: Is it multi-tenant?**

A: Yes, each HF user gets an isolated vault with per-user search indexes.

**Q: Where's the source code?**

A: See [[Getting Started]] for links to the repository.

## Tips

- Organize content with plain folders; each note is a Markdown file.
- Wikilink to other notes with `[[Example Note]]` once you create them.
- Data in this demo space is ephemeral and may reset when the app restarts.
